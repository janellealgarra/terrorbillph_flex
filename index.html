          <p class ="subHead"><i>What does this mean?</i></p>
          <p class ="about">The anti-terrorist act of 2020 was a bill approved by President Rodrigo Duterte. The purpose of the
            bill is to prevent terrorism from occuring in the Philippines. However, the bill uses such a broad
            definition of "terrorism" that it could be subjected to abuse. Part of the bill states that "speeches, writings,
            proclamations, emblems, banners, and other representations tending to the same end" could carry a punishment of
            12 years in prison. This gives officials the right to investigate suspects without warrant. Recent events such as
            the closure of the Philippines biggest network ABS-CBN and the arrest of Maria Ressa among others have proved that
            the anti-terrorism bill could potentially be another way the government may try and prevent citizens speaking up
            against them.
