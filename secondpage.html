      <p class ="newsOne">Para Sa Pinas: Freedom of Speech Amid the Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act</p>
    <p>The election of Rodrigo Duterte, the 16th President of the Philippines, in October 2016 signified a drastic change in the country’s political landscape. Despite Duterte’s noticeably high approval ratings — among the highest since democracy was reinstated in 1986 — the current administration has been associated with a string of questionable and relatively undemocratic practices. Duterte’s election stirred much controversy as critics began to suggest an erosion of fundamental democratic values, evidenced by his vehement “war on drugs.” Additionally, the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), signed in early July 2020, appears to be Duterte’s latest effort to lock the Philippines in its descent into a military regime. <a href="https://www.mironline.ca/para-sa-pinas-freedom-of-speech-amid-the-philippines-anti-terrorism-act/">read more </a></p>

      <p class ="newsTwo">What you should know about 'anti-democracy' laws in the PH, Hong Kong, Thailand</p>
      <p>In the ongoing pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong, Thailand, and the Philippines, one thing they have in common is dissent against laws perceived to clamp down on free speech and the right to criticize the government. People have taken to the streets to fight for democracy even as a deadly coronavirus plagues the world. In Asia, people from the Philippines, Thailand, and Hong Kong have staged mass demonstrations against perceived government power grabs. One thing the movements have in common is protesters’ dissent against laws believed to infringe on their freedom to speak out and criticize the government.

      <p class ="newsThree">Proposed US bill seeks to halt security aid to PH over Anti-Terrorism Law</p>
      <p>A BILL seeking to suspend the United States’ aid to Philippine security forces due to the alleged human rights violations under the Duterte administration has been formally introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives.
      Rep. Susan Wild, a Democrat who represents Pennsylvania’s 7th congressional district, introduced House Resolution 8313, also known as the Philippine Human Rights Act, on Thursday, Sept. 17.
      “Today, across the Philippines, (President) Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal regime is using the pretext of a so-called anti-terrorism law to ramp up efforts targeting labor organizers, workers, and political opponents,” Wild said in her speech on the House floor.
